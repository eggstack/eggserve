# Guide for AI coding agents

## Project overview

eggserve is a security-oriented, Rust-backed static file server with safe-by-default behavior, intended as a hardened replacement for `python -m http.server`. It ships as a CLI binary and a Python-packaged tool, backed by a Rust library for path confinement, policy enforcement, and response construction. Resource limits and operational hardening (plan 004) are implemented.

## Non-negotiables

- **Safe defaults are not defaults if they can be overridden silently.** Every security default (loopback bind, no symlinks, no dotfiles, no directory listing) is enforced unless the user explicitly passes a flag. See [docs/security-policy.md](docs/security-policy.md).
- **No serving outside the configured root.** Path traversal and symlink escape must be denied at the library level. See [docs/threat-model.md](docs/threat-model.md).
- **No broad dependencies.** Every dependency must have an explicit purpose. See [docs/dependency-policy.md](docs/dependency-policy.md). Current dependencies: `thiserror` (errors), `tokio` (async runtime), `hyper`/`hyper-util`/`http-body-util` (HTTP), `bytes` (buffers), `futures-util` (streaming bodies), `httpdate` (Last-Modified), `phf` (MIME map).
- **Plan-driven development.** Every change must be backed by a plan in `plans/`. No ad-hoc feature additions.

`eggserve-python/` is not yet a Cargo crate; Python packaging is deferred to plan 005.

## Common commands

CI runs these in order; match it locally before pushing:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check                                 # format check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings      # lint (warnings are errors)
cargo test --workspace                                     # tests
```

Run a single crate with `-p <name>` (e.g. `cargo test -p eggserve-core`).

## Toolchain notes

- Rust edition 2021, workspace `resolver = "2"`.
- No `rustfmt.toml` / `clippy.toml` — defaults apply; CI enforces `-D warnings`.
- `target/` is gitignored; `cargo build` / `cargo test` are sufficient setup (no pre-build step, no codegen).
- `cargo run -p eggserve-bin` starts an HTTP server on `127.0.0.1:8000` serving static files from the current directory. See [crates/eggserve-bin/src/main.rs](crates/eggserve-bin/src/main.rs).

## Plan-driven development

All implementation work must be traced to a plan in `plans/`. Plans define scope, acceptance criteria, and boundaries. Do not implement features that are not covered by an existing plan. If a change requires expanding scope, update the relevant plan first.

## Scope discipline

Before implementing any feature, check:

1. Does the feature appear in a plan in `plans/`?
2. Is it listed as a non-goal in `docs/non-goals.md`? If so, the non-goal must be updated first.
3. Does it affect the threat model? If so, update `docs/threat-model.md`.

## Don'ts

- Do not add broad dependencies without justification (see [docs/dependency-policy.md](docs/dependency-policy.md))
- Do not add comments to code unless explicitly asked
- Do not make broad PRs that touch multiple unrelated files
- Do not create files outside the directories specified by plans
