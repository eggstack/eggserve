# eggserve Development Skill

## Project identity

eggserve is a security-oriented, Rust-backed static file server with safe-by-default behavior. It ships as a CLI binary and a Python-packaged tool, backed by a Rust library for path confinement, policy enforcement, and response construction.

**Not** a general web server, framework, ASGI/WSGI runtime, or Granian replacement.

## Workspace layout

Three crates:
- `crates/eggserve-core/` — library: security primitives, path confinement, HTTP serving, response construction
- `crates/eggserve-bin/` — binary: CLI, accept loop, signal handling (depends on eggserve-core)
- `crates/eggserve-python/` — Python wheel packaging (maturin + PyO3, depends on eggserve-core; excluded from workspace; bundles the platform-native CLI binary)

Other directories: `architecture/` (14 deep-dive docs), `docs/` (reference docs), `plans/` (000–059 plus roadmap and closure documents), `release/` (criteria.toml), `conformance/` (shared corpora), `examples/`, `fuzz/`.

## Non-negotiables

1. **Safe defaults** — loopback bind, no symlinks, no dotfiles, no directory listing. Every unsafe behavior requires explicit opt-in via CLI flag.
2. **No serving outside root** — path traversal and symlink escape denied at library level. On Unix with safe defaults, descriptor-relative traversal via `statat(AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW)` + `openat(O_NOFOLLOW)`.
3. **No broad dependencies** — every dependency must have an explicit purpose. See `docs/dependency-policy.md`.
4. **Plan-driven development** — every change must be traced to a plan in `plans/`. No ad-hoc feature additions.

## CI validation sequence

Run before pushing:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check                                 # format check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings      # lint
cargo test --workspace                                     # tests
cargo clippy -p eggserve-bin --features tls --all-targets -- -D warnings  # TLS lint
cargo test -p eggserve-bin --features tls                  # TLS tests
cargo test -p eggserve-core --features client              # client feature tests
cargo test -p eggserve-core --test http_wire_correctness   # raw wire tests
cargo test -p eggserve-core --test http_primitives_integration  # HTTP integration
cargo test -p eggserve-bin --test production_path          # production path tests
cargo test -p eggserve-core --test corpus_replay           # fuzz corpus replay
cargo test -p eggserve-core --test canonical_conformance  # canonical HTTP type conformance
cargo test -p eggserve-core --test canonical_wire_interop  # canonical wire interop
cargo test -p eggserve-core --test request_body_integration  # request body ingestion integration
cargo test -p eggserve-core --test request_body_wire  # request body wire tests
cargo audit                                                # vulnerability check
cargo deny check                                           # license/policy check
bash scripts/verify-cargo-packages.sh                      # package and publish dry-run gates
python3 scripts/check-contract-consistency.py              # contract consistency validation
```

## Key conventions

- **Manual argument parsing** in `args.rs` — no clap dependency
- **Two DotfilePolicy types** — `path::DotfilePolicy` (parsing) and `policy::DotfilePolicy` (serving). Both must agree.
- **eggserve-python excluded from workspace** — has its own Cargo.lock, built via maturin. Don't run `cargo test --workspace` for Python crate.
- **Frozen Python classes** — `#[pyclass(frozen)]` and `frozen=True` dataclasses
- **`#[allow(dead_code)]` on public API types** — consumed externally (Python bindings)
- **Two error types** — `PathRejection` (16 variants, parsing) vs `Error` (top-level taxonomy). `RequestValidationError` for HTTP-level issues.
- **Plan status** — Plans 000–059 are complete. Plan 055 verifies Milestone 3 final state. Plan 059 closes Milestone 4: TE+CL rejection, duplicate Content-Length policy, one-shot consumption errors, transport adapter visibility cleanup, error taxonomy audit, and conformance corpus alignment. Plan 060 establishes production support profiles, documentation alignment, contract consistency tests, API stability reinforcement, and threat model revision. Production profiles are machine-readable in `release/support-profiles.toml`.
- **Canonical HTTP types (stable)** — Plan 049 promotes all canonical HTTP types to stable. `Method`, `HttpVersion`, `HeaderBlock`, `RequestTarget`, `RequestHead`, `ConnectionInfo` (request types) and `StatusCode`, `ResponseHead`, `ResponseBody`, `Response`, `normalize_response()` (response types) are all stable.
- **Canonical response normalization** — All response producers converge on `primitives::canonical::normalize_metadata()` for response metadata and framing.
- **`server` module types** — `eggserve-core::server` provides the runtime service boundary for embedding: `Server`, `ServerBuilder`, `ServerHandle`, `RuntimeConfig`, `Service` trait, `service_fn`, `StaticService`, `StaticServiceBuilder`. Lifecycle types: `LifecycleState` (Created, Starting, Running, Draining, Stopped, Failed). The module is experimental; API may change.
- **RequestBody is one-shot** — `RequestBody` can only be consumed once. The `Service` trait's `call` method takes `Request` by value. Body policy defaults to `Reject`.
- **Python RequestBody** — `RequestBody.read()` and `RequestBody.iter_chunks()` are mutually exclusive. `iter_chunks()` bridges async Rust body to synchronous Python via bounded channel with backpressure.

## Architecture docs

The `architecture/` directory contains deep-dive docs for each subsystem:
- `overview.md` — workspace structure, data flow, architectural decisions
- `eggserve-core.md` — core library module map, key types, error taxonomy
- `eggserve-bin.md` — CLI binary, accept loop, signal handling
- `eggserve-python.md` — Python bindings, PyO3, maturin packaging
- `path-confinement.md` — path validation pipeline
- `filesystem-confinement.md` — SecureRoot, symlink-aware resolution
- `policy-system.md` — StaticPolicy, symlink/dotfile/listing policies
- `primitives-api.md` — public API boundary for embedding consumers
- `response-planning.md` — conditional/range/ETag response planning
- `runtime.md` — runtime service boundary, Server, Service trait, StaticService
- `client.md` — HTTP client primitives, feature-gated substrate
- `security-model.md` — trust boundaries, defensive layers, attacker model
- `release-infrastructure.md` — release criteria, evidence aggregation, CI gates
- `testing-and-conformance.md` — test layers, conformance corpora, fuzzing

## Common pitfalls

- `telemetry.rs` is referenced in some older docs but does not exist — do not create it
- Range requests ARE implemented (despite some docs saying otherwise)
- `clap` was removed — manual arg parsing in `args.rs`
- `tracing` was never added — logging is custom
- Error taxonomy: `PathEscape` is a unit variant, `PathNotAccessible(String)` takes a string, `Bind(String)` takes a string
- `BodyPlan` variants: `Empty`, `FullBytes(Vec<u8>)`, `FileFull`, `FileRange { start, end_inclusive }`
- `ResponseStatus` is a struct with associated constants, not an enum
- `FileRange` is a struct `{ start: u64, end_inclusive: u64 }`, not an enum
- `StaticPolicy` field is `symlinks`, not `follow_symlinks`
- **Client is buffered-only** — `HttpClient` buffers full response in memory. Streaming is not yet supported.
- **`ResolvedFile` extraction methods** — `from_parts()`, `into_std_file()`, `into_parts()` are `pub` (for cross-crate Python bindings) but carry security caveats: confinement guarantee ends after extraction.
- **Python Server has runtime hardening** — connection semaphore, header/write timeouts, graceful shutdown, optional handler callback, callback concurrency limit.
- **Python wheel support** — CPython 3.14 only (`>=3.14,<3.15`) on the Linux, macOS, and Windows wheel matrix.
- **Release validation** — run `bash scripts/install-cargo-tools.sh` before `cargo audit`/`cargo deny check`.
- **Release criteria** — `release/criteria.toml` is the single source of truth for release gates.
- **Canonical HTTP types (stable)** — `Method`, `HttpVersion`, `HeaderBlock`, `RequestTarget`, `RequestHead`, `ConnectionInfo`, `StatusCode`, `ResponseHead`, `ResponseBody`, `Response`, `normalize_response()` are all stable.
- **`server` module is experimental** — `eggserve-core::server` provides the runtime service boundary. Its API is subject to change without notice.
- **Production profiles** — `release/support-profiles.toml` defines 7 production profiles. Every production claim must name a profile. Hardened profiles must not allow symlink following. Windows is functional-only until reparse hardening evidence passes.
