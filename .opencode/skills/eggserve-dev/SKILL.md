# eggserve Development Skill

## Project identity

eggserve is a security-oriented, Rust-backed static file server with safe-by-default behavior. It ships as a CLI binary and a Python-packaged tool, backed by a Rust library for path confinement, policy enforcement, and response construction.

**Not** a general web server, framework, ASGI/WSGI runtime, or Granian replacement.

## Workspace layout

Three crates:
- `crates/eggserve-core/` — library: security primitives, path confinement, HTTP serving, response construction
- `crates/eggserve-bin/` — binary: CLI, accept loop, signal handling (depends on eggserve-core)
- `crates/eggserve-python/` — Python wheel packaging (maturin + PyO3, depends on eggserve-core; excluded from workspace; bundles the platform-native CLI binary)

Other directories: `architecture/` (10 deep-dive docs), `docs/` (reference docs), `plans/` (000–048 plus roadmap and closure documents), `release/` (criteria.toml), `examples/`, `fuzz/`.

## Non-negotiables

1. **Safe defaults** — loopback bind, no symlinks, no dotfiles, no directory listing. Every unsafe behavior requires explicit opt-in via CLI flag.
2. **No serving outside root** — path traversal and symlink escape denied at library level. On Unix with safe defaults, descriptor-relative traversal via `statat(AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW)` + `openat(O_NOFOLLOW)`.
3. **No broad dependencies** — every dependency must have an explicit purpose. See `docs/dependency-policy.md`.
4. **Plan-driven development** — every change must be traced to a plan in `plans/`. No ad-hoc feature additions.

## CI validation sequence

Run before pushing:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check                                 # format check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings      # lint
cargo test --workspace                                     # tests
cargo clippy -p eggserve-bin --features tls --all-targets -- -D warnings  # TLS lint
cargo test -p eggserve-bin --features tls                  # TLS tests
cargo test -p eggserve-core --features client              # client feature tests
cargo test -p eggserve-core --test http_wire_correctness   # raw wire tests
cargo test -p eggserve-core --test http_primitives_integration  # HTTP integration
cargo test -p eggserve-bin --test production_path          # production path tests
cargo test -p eggserve-core --test corpus_replay           # fuzz corpus replay
cargo audit                                                # vulnerability check
cargo deny check                                           # license/policy check
```

## Key conventions

- **Manual argument parsing** in `args.rs` — no clap dependency
- **Two DotfilePolicy types** — `path::DotfilePolicy` (parsing) and `policy::DotfilePolicy` (serving). Both must agree.
- **eggserve-python excluded from workspace** — has its own Cargo.lock, built via maturin. Don't run `cargo test --workspace` for Python crate.
- **Frozen Python classes** — `#[pyclass(frozen)]` and `frozen=True` dataclasses
- **`#[allow(dead_code)]` on public API types** — consumed externally (Python bindings)
- **Two error types** — `PathRejection` (16 variants, parsing) vs `Error` (top-level taxonomy). `RequestValidationError` for HTTP-level issues.
- **Plan status** — Plans 000–051 are complete. Plan 047 establishes canonical HTTP request types (`Method`, `HttpVersion`, `HeaderBlock`, `RequestTarget`, `RequestHead`, `ConnectionInfo`) in `primitives::`. Plan 048 establishes canonical response types (`StatusCode`, `ResponseHead`, `ResponseBody`, `Response`, `normalize_response`) in `primitives::canonical` and a single normalization path for all response producers. Plan 049 promotes all canonical HTTP types to stable and establishes the conformance corpus for Rust/Python parity testing. Plan 050 closes Milestone 2 by correcting StatusCode validation (100–999), unifying canonical response metadata across all response producers via `normalize_metadata()`, enforcing hop-by-hop header stripping, and completing the response architecture audit. Plan 051 establishes the Milestone 3A runtime service boundary: `server::Server`, `ServerBuilder`, `ServerHandle`, `RuntimeConfig`, `Service` trait, `service_fn`, `StaticService`, and `StaticServiceBuilder` in `eggserve-core::server`. Plan 052 establishes the Milestone 3B lifecycle: lifecycle state machine (Created→Starting→Running→Draining→Stopped/Failed), listener abstraction (bind/from_listener), readiness signaling, graceful/forced shutdown with drain deadline, and connection/task registry in `eggserve-core::server`. The `server` module is experimental and its API is subject to change. Plans 042–045 establish the release evidence infrastructure: a capability matrix (`docs/library-capability-matrix.md`), machine-readable release criteria (`release/criteria.toml`), a criteria validator (`scripts/release_criteria.py`), and a unified local validation script (`scripts/release-validate.sh`). CI gate names are normalized to match criteria gate IDs, and evidence aggregation runs after all gate jobs. Verify release status from `docs/release-checklist.md`, not workflow YAML alone.

## Architecture docs

The `architecture/` directory contains deep-dive docs for each subsystem:
- `overview.md` — workspace structure, data flow, architectural decisions
- `eggserve-core.md` — core library module map, key types, error taxonomy
- `eggserve-bin.md` — CLI binary, accept loop, signal handling
- `eggserve-python.md` — Python bindings, PyO3, maturin packaging
- `path-confinement.md` — path validation pipeline
- `filesystem-confinement.md` — SecureRoot, symlink-aware resolution
- `policy-system.md` — StaticPolicy, symlink/dotfile/listing policies
- `primitives-api.md` — public API boundary for embedding consumers
- `response-planning.md` — conditional/range/ETag response planning
- `runtime.md` — runtime service boundary, Server, Service trait, StaticService

## Common pitfalls

- `telemetry.rs` is referenced in some older docs but does not exist — do not create it
- Range requests ARE implemented (despite some docs saying otherwise)
- `clap` was removed — manual arg parsing in `args.rs`
- `tracing` was never added — logging is custom
- Error taxonomy: `PathEscape` is a unit variant, `PathNotAccessible(String)` takes a string, `Bind(String)` takes a string
- `BodyPlan` variants: `Empty`, `FullBytes(Vec<u8>)`, `FileFull`, `FileRange { start, end_inclusive }`
- `ResponseStatus` is a struct with associated constants, not an enum
- `FileRange` is a struct `{ start: u64, end_inclusive: u64 }`, not an enum
- `StaticPolicy` field is `symlinks`, not `follow_symlinks`
- **Client is buffered-only** — `HttpClient` buffers full response in memory. Streaming is not yet supported.
- **`ResolvedFile` extraction methods** — `from_parts()`, `into_std_file()`, `into_parts()` are `pub` (for cross-crate Python bindings) but carry security caveats: confinement guarantee ends after extraction. External consumers should use `SecureRoot` resolution.
- **Python Server has runtime hardening** — connection semaphore, header/write timeouts, graceful shutdown, optional handler callback, callback concurrency limit. Parameters: `handler`, `public`, `max_connections`, `max_file_streams`, `max_python_callbacks`, `header_timeout_secs`, `write_timeout_secs`.
- **Python wheel support** — CPython 3.14 only (`>=3.14,<3.15`) on the Linux, macOS, and Windows wheel matrix. Builds require `PYO3_USE_ABI3_FORWARD_COMPATIBILITY=1` with PyO3 0.24.2 and stage `eggserve-bin` under `python/eggserve/bin/` before maturin.
- **Release validation** — run `bash scripts/install-cargo-tools.sh` before `cargo audit`/`cargo deny check`, and `bash scripts/verify-cargo-packages.sh` for both Rust package gates. The release workflow's manual `dry_run=true` path must be executed and recorded before RC approval.
- **Release criteria** — `release/criteria.toml` is the single source of truth for release gates. `scripts/release_criteria.py` validates the criteria file and generates the release checklist. `scripts/release-validate.sh` provides unified local validation.
- **Contract consistency** — `scripts/check-contract-consistency.py` validates documentation claims (TLS, Python version, packages, platforms, API inventory, README links). Run via `./scripts/release-validate.sh metadata`.
- **Canonical HTTP types (stable)** — Plan 049 promotes all canonical HTTP types to stable after conformance completion. `Method`, `HttpVersion`, `HeaderBlock`, `RequestTarget`, `RequestHead`, `ConnectionInfo` (request types) and `StatusCode`, `ResponseHead`, `ResponseBody`, `Response`, `normalize_response()` (response types) are all stable. `ReadOnlyMethod` (GET/HEAD only) remains stable for existing consumers. `Method` supports standard + extension methods. `HeaderBlock` preserves duplicates; `get_unique()` returns `DuplicateHeaderError` on duplicates. `RequestHead::try_from_hyper()` converts Hyper requests. Python equivalents: `Method`, `HttpVersion`, `HeaderBlock`, `ConnectionInfo`, `CanonicalRequest`.
- **Canonical response normalization** — All response producers converge on `primitives::canonical::normalize_metadata()` for response metadata and framing. `normalize_response()` applies HEAD suppression, body-forbidden enforcement, and hop-by-hop stripping for in-memory bodies. `normalize_metadata()` applies the same framing rules (Transfer-Encoding stripping, Content-Length computation) for file-backed bodies without consuming the body. `to_hyper_response()` converts to Hyper after normalization. Python handler responses use this path for non-file bodies.
- **Unified response architecture** — All response producers converge on `normalize_metadata()` for metadata normalization. In-memory bodies use `normalize_response()` → `to_hyper_response()`. File-backed bodies use `normalize_metadata(headers, body_len)` → streaming transport.
- **`server` module types** — `eggserve-core::server` provides the runtime service boundary for embedding: `Server` (entry point), `ServerBuilder` (configured builder, `bind(addr)`, `from_listener(listener)`), `ServerHandle` (control handle, `ready().await`, `force_shutdown(deadline)`, `state()`), `RuntimeConfig` (transport config, separate from `ServeConfig`), `Service` trait (transport-independent service abstraction), `service_fn` (create service from closure), `ServiceError` (per-request errors), `ServerError` (lifecycle errors), `StaticService` (hardened static file service), `StaticServiceBuilder`. Lifecycle types: `LifecycleState` (Created, Starting, Running, Draining, Stopped, Failed), `ShutdownResult` (Clean, Timeout, Forced). The module is experimental; API may change.
